      <p> Hi, my name is Leonardo Barranco. I moved to the United States from Venezuela, and I am currently studying IT. 
      While I am not yet sure what I want to do with my degree, I go to school full-time and work full-time as a project manager for a flooring company. 
      In my current job, I visit homes to take measurements and work with clients to ensure that our projects meet their expectations. 
      I am a dog person; my fiancée and I have a Dachshund named Dobby, named after the character from Harry Potter, which reflects our nerdy interests. 
      I have really enjoyed this class and appreciate it for teaching me more about how to create a website. This has been a very cool project—challenging, but definitely rewarding.
    </p>
